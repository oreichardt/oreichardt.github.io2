				<p>I have been on a lot of meaningful trips in my life and I am very grateful. A spot that will forever hold a big piece of my heart though is <a href="https://daytonabeach.com"> Daytona Beach, Florida. </a> I spent a week each summer going to Daytona Beach for as long as I remember. It was always the highlight of my summer going there with my family and friends. We were able to spend time as a family together, back in the warm weather, and go out to eat at great restaurants! </p>
